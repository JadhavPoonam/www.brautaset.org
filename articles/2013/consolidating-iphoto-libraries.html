<h1 class="title">Consolidating and de-duplicating iPhoto libraries</h1>
<p>
This explains how I consolidated &amp; de-duped about 45,000 pictures and
movies from four iPhoto libraries on two different machines and various
directories full of images on USB drives into one 33,000 file library.
</p>

<p>
We had about 25,000 photos in one library from a previous (unsuccessful)
attempt at consolidating libraries. We had two further libraries
containing about 13,000 and 10,000 images each, and a fourth iPhoto
library on a separate machine, plus the aforementioned random grab-bag
of directories full of images. (I didn't count how many these were, but
they numbered in the thousands.) After consolidation we ended up with
33,000 images and movies in one iPhoto library.
</p>

<p>
iPhoto has a menu item for finding duplicates, but I was not been able
to make it work; it would just hang trying to find duplicates in one of
the smaller libraries. And even if I could get that to work I didn't
have the space to copy all the images into one giant library and let
iPhoto sort it out. So I wrote a program to help me.
</p>

<p>
One problem was that the same picture would exist with different file
names, probably due to being imported from devices into multiple
different iPhoto libraries or to being exported &amp; then imported again in
the aforementioned failed consolidation attempt. We also had different
images existing with the same name, due to the counter on the camera
looping around. This was OK since iPhoto stores images from different
imports in different directories, but it meant that we couldn't just
copy all the files into one directory and use the names to de-duplicate
them.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a simple program to iterate over all image &amp; movie files in a
directory and create a copy of each named after the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5 hash</a> of its content. Thus
files whose content were identical, but had different names, would now
end up with the same name. I did not want to end up with tens of
thousands of files in one directory, so I made my program put each file
in a directory named after the 2 first characters of each file's name.
Here it is:

Since I didn't have enough disk space to duplicate all the images, I
used hardlinks. This essentially means you just create a new filename
pointing to the same data on disk, without taking up extra data. I also
made the program create a log file containing the location of each file
and its MD5 hash so I could find out how many files were processed and
how many duplicates were found.
</p>

<p>
A problem with the MD5 hash approach would be if duplicate copies of
images had different image metadata. This could be the case is some
copies had had their dates adjusted or if iPhoto where changing the EXIF
information when you star photos or tag faces in them. Fortunately, a
little experimentation showed that iPhoto does not change the image
files but stores this extra information in a separate database. My
approach would thus mean that we would lose stars &amp; face tags, but we
considered this an acceptable trade off. Consolidating and de-duping the
libraries would be worth it.
</p>

<p>
What if the EXIF information <i>had</i> been edited? (Some image managers
do.) Would all hope be lost? No, it would not. The Imagemagick suite of
tools comes with the <i>identify</i> program, which allows you to get a hash
of just the image data. This would allow us to find more duplicates,
even if the EXIF information had been edited; however it runs much,
<i>much</i> slower than just using MD5 so I chose not to use it.
</p>

<p>
One worry I had was how to make sure I got hold of all the originals
from iPhoto. Due to the aforementioned space constraint I couldn't just
export all the photos and thus create new copies. However, this turned
out not to be an issue. iPhoto stores its originals in a <i>Masters</i>
directory, along parallel directories for <i>Previews</i> and <i>Thumbnails</i>.
Thus I just ran my program on the Masters directory. One risk would be
losing edits to images, but I was OK with this.
</p>

<p>
In the end I had 255 directories with on average 130 files in each. I
imported these directories into a brand new iPhoto library roughly ten
at a time. Since iPhoto doesn't use hardlinks but copies the photos into
its library (to avoid nasty surprises if someone decided to edit the
file in a different location, no doubt) this ate up disk fast; and I had
to delete the existing libraries under the different accounts to make
room. Since I had Time Machine backups (yes, plural&#x2014;I rotate two Time
Machine disks) I felt OK doing this.
</p>

<p>
We are really happy with the result :-)
</p>

<b>Update 2014/05/08:</b> A few days ago I received a question to this post
from Jeff Ruth. Because it, and its answer, may be useful to more people
I asked if I could reproduce it here.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Hello and thanks for the post about your iPhoto consolidation and
de-duping. I'd love to do something similar. We have three Apple
laptops (two MacBooks from 2008 and 2009) and a new Macbook Pro
Retina. In all, about 3-5 iPHoto libraries, I think. Your project
seems to be what we'd like to do. However, I'm not sure how to do it.
If you have a minute, could you please tell me how I can use your
code, or do this a different way, without the program? I am not a
programmer, but have used Terminal now and then and am not afraid to
experiment if necessary. Thanks a lot, in advance.
</p>

<p>

<p>
My response:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Do your libraries contain duplicates? If not, I wouldn't bother with
this approach. We only needed to because we had imported the same
photos into multiple photo albums.
</p>

<p>
The script was intended for developers, but if you want to try you
have to copy the file (dedupe-media.sh) to your local disk, then make
it executable. In Terminal, you do that with ‘chmod +x
dedupe-media.sh'. (Without the quotes.) You then run the script like
so:
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>/path/to/dedupe-media.sh /path/to/iPhotoLibrary/Masters /destination/path</code>
</p>

<p>
If you want to run this on multiple laptops you may want to make the
destination a single USB disk (or something) so probably
/Volumes/My\<sub>USB</sub>\<sub>Disk</sub>\<sub>Name</sub>. This disk will accumulate unique photos.
The product is just a big folder of files, which will have to imported
into a new library. All metadata (faces, etc) will have to attached
again.
</p>

<p>
Please note this script comes with NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. You must
take adequate backup of your libraries before running the above.
Although I have made my best attempt at making the script work (and it
does for me!), I take no responsibility for any data loss you may
experience.

<b>Update 2015/08/16:</b> One annoyance under iTunes is that the "rolls" or
"albums" feature is utterly meaningless, because you've got 255 albums
named "00", "01", "..", "fe", "ff". However, you can fix that by running
<code>exiftool</code> over the resulting files to have them grouped by year and
month (there are
<a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/filename.html">more
examples in the exiftool documentation</a>):
</p>

<pre class="example">
exiftool -d %Y/%m "-directory&lt;datetimeoriginal" DIR_OF_FILES
</pre>

<p>
This moves the images found in <code>DIR_OF_FILES</code> into a directory structure
based on the year and month the data was taken, as taken from the Exif
data in the image itself. The structure will be like so:
</p>

<pre class="example">
2009/11/foo.jpg
2009/11/bar.jpg
2010/01/baz.jpg
2010/01/qux.jpg
</pre>

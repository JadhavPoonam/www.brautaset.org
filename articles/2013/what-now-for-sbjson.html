<h1 class="title">What now for SBJson?</h1>
<p>
In the middle of 2007 I was given roughly six months notice that I would
be made redundant from Fotango as the company was to be shut down.
Around the same time CouchDB started to emerge and caught my interest.
Given I had some spare time on my hands, I set out to try and write some
Objective-C CouchDB bindings.
</p>

<p>
Fairly soon I was hindered by the lack of a suitable Objective-C JSON
library. I decided to write one. How much work could it really <i>be</i>? I
temporarily shelved the CouchDB bindings and started working on what
would become SBJson. The first version was just a category on NSScanner;
however, for the first public release (v0.1) it had changed to the
category methods on NSArray, NSDictionary, and NSString that people know
and love today.
</p>

<p>
Version 2 added an OO interface, the single SBJSON class. Version 2.2
extracted separate SBJsonParser &amp; SBJsonWriter classes from that, and
deprecated it. (It was a mess.) Each step of the way the existing APIs
were re-defined in terms of the new, lower-level APIs to keep backwards
compatibility. I did a booboo with the v2.3 release and removed the
aforementioned SBJSON class in a minor release. In retrospect I should
simply have called this version 3.
</p>

<p>
Starting in 2008 people were able to write their own apps for the
iPhone. It turns out the iOS SDK was lacking was JSON support, and many
<i>many</i> people started using SBJson. Over the years:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Apple used it for their Stanford University iPhone course.</li>
<li>Apple used it in iOS itself from iOS 3 onwards.</li>
<li>Google Maps for iOS until iOS 6.</li>
<li>The Flickr iOS app.</li>
<li>The Facebook SDK.</li>
<li>Instagram.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In June 2011 I released SBJson version 3. This release saw streaming
support, an even lower level API than the regular OO one. This time the
OO API was re-defined in terms of the streaming API, so yet again we
kept compatibility. Actually I added two streaming APIs, one low-level
and one high-level. So now we have <i>four</i> levels of APIs.
</p>

<p>
March 2013. Things, as they say, they are a-changing. iOS 5 was released
nearly a year and a half ago and added native JSON support in the iOS
SDK, in the form of the NSJSONSerialisation class. I would neither
expect nor recommend anyone to use SBJson if NSJSONSerialisation covers
their need, so there really is only two cases where I see SBJson
providing value:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You need streaming support.</li>
<li>You're adding JSON support to an app that needs to support iOS
version 4.x or below.</li>
</ol>

<p>
But doesn't NSJSONSerialisation support streaming too? Well, yes; in a
sense. NSJSONSerialisation supports NSStream, but it still will only
give you the document after it is finished parsing it. This means if you
download a document over a slow link you will never get any of the
results until the entire document has been downloaded. And it has to
hold the entire finished document in memory, which could be a waste if
you're only interested in parts of it.
</p>

<p>
SBJson's streaming API doesn't use NSStream, but you can feed it parts
of a large (potentially endless) document in bite-sized NSData chunks,
and register a delegate that will receive various parts of the document
as soon as they are parsed. <i>You never have to hold the entire structure
in memory.</i> It also means that if you're downloading a long array over a
slow link, you can <i>start showing results before the entire array has
finished downloading</i>. I chose the NSData chunks interface rather than a
NSStream one because it plays better with NSURLConnection and other HTTP
libraries. It was also simpler to implement and test.
</p>

<p>
Regarding the latter point: if you're having to add JSON support to an
iOS 4.x (or lower) app at this point, I think having to call
<code>[[SBJsonParser new] objectWithString:foo]</code> rather than
<code>[foo JSONValue]</code> is probably going to be the least of your problems.
Thus version 3.2 saw the category methods, and the methods returning
NSErrors through a pointer, deprecated, and these will be removed in V4.
I'm hoping this will allow me to focus on keeping SBJson relevant.
</p>

<p>
It might seem such a small amount of code, so why not just keep them in?
The main reasons for cutting the the category methods are:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Support. Failing to specify the correct flags to get categories
working on iOS is the biggest issue people currently have with the
library. (Except perhaps imagined memory leaks, from people compiling
SBJson without ARC.)</li>
<li>Support, again. When the category methods return nil, there's no
obvious way to get at the error. In 3.x the methods NSLog the error,
but it's not ideal. I don't want to throw exceptions either.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Regarding the removal of the methods that return errors through a
parameter: it is difficult to say how many use those successfully, since
I don't instrument the library in any way. But I can say from empirical
observation (mainly in questions on
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>) that people don't use those
methods in any meaningful way. People generally prefer them to the
equivalent ones without the error parameter, <i>but they almost always
pass NULL as the error argument</i>. I think people simply don't understand
how these error pointers work.
</p>

<p>
So this is where we are in March 2013: I still maintain SBJson, aka
json-framework&#x2014;I never really got around to play with CouchDB, let
alone finish those bindings. I was never paid a single pence, directly,
for this development; however, I did land a job in part due to being its
author. Also, I had a couple of free beers at a London iOS developers
meeting that ended up in a pub. So I consider myself well rewarded.

<h1 class="title">Backing Up Photos Online</h1>
<p>
We use Time Machine to back up our main computer. We have two 1GB USB
drives that we rotate. Every so often I take the drive currently plugged
into the computer to work and swap it with an HD I store there. (Order
is important; I <i>never</i> take both backup disks home at the same time for
any length of time, not even just to swap them around.) I plug this in
when I get home and continue backing up. This means we have three copies
of our data, in two different locations. So if our flat burns down, or
someone steals both computer and backup drive, we should still have a
moderately up-to-date complete set of data at my office.
</p>

<p>
Until recently we also used a dedicated "whole disk" backup service
called Backblaze. It has a trickle backup agent, a bit like Dropbox,
that sits and watches the disk for any changes and copy them up to their
servers. Unfortunately we found it to adversely affect performance of
the machine. I have no hard data for this, it was just a gut-feeling.
Backblaze certainly had good points, like backing up USB drives
permanently attached to the machine, so I'm sad it didn't work out but
we decided to give it up.
</p>

<p>
I'm nothing if not paranoid, so to help me sleep better at night I have
been thinking about online backups, and <i>what I really want to back up</i>
a lot. Any writing &amp; source code is already on GitHub or in Dropbox.
Apps I use are either free, or purchased through AppStore, so can be
freely re-downloaded. Music is backed up in iTunes Match. Films? I don't
have a lot, and iTunes may let me re-download purchased ones; but I
rarely re-watch films anyway so it's no great loss. In the worst case
they can be re-purchased as there's nothing personal about them.
</p>

<p>
So it all boils down to photos, really. They're annoyingly big, there's
a lot of them, and they're <i>impossible to replace</i> by throwing money at
the problem. I decided to look into a number of different services for
backing up photos online. We use iPhoto on a Mac to manage our photos,
and we wanted something that integrates with that setup.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-flickr">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Cheap: US $25/year.</li>
<li>Has been around for a long time &amp; has an established business model
with actual paying users so will hopefully stick around for a while
yet.</li>
<li>Powerful privacy controls.</li>
<li><b>Doesn't delete your photos even if your pro subscription lapses.</b></li>
<li>It is a specialist photo site, allowing tagging and organisation into
albums, etc.</li>
<li>iPhoto integration.</li>
<li>Flickr iPhone app could upload photos taken on our iPhones straight
to the account without having to go via the computer.</li>
<li>We both already have Flickr accounts, so we have some history with
them.</li>
<li>Main drawback: affiliated with Yahoo!</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-dropbox">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Expensive! We have about 140GB of photos currently, so would have to
go for their $200/year plan. That's 8 times the cost of Flickr.</li>
<li>Has some special handling for photos, but just for sharing (as far as
I can see).</li>
<li>We'd end up with two copies of each photo on disk, unless we moved
the entire iPhoto library to be inside the Dropbox folder. (Not
entirely sure if that would actually work? I worry about metadata
corruption.)</li>
<li>No iPhoto integration; very low-tech files-in-a-folder solution.</li>
<li>Supports uploading of photos directly from iPhone, using the Dropbox
iPhone app. But they would not be added to the main collection
automatically.</li>

Apparently dying. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/05/picasa-web-albums-are-officially-dead-now-%20redirect-to-google-photos/">Users are being migrated to Google+ Photos</a>, which
has too much integration with the Google ecosystem for what we want.
We are looking for a <i>backup solution that understands photos</i>, not a
plethora of ways to accidentally share pictures with all our contacts.
So that's a no.

<p>
Flickr came out on top due to them being cheapest, their iPhoto
integration, and their "we won't delete your photos even if your
subscription lapses" feature. (I can vouch for this; I have experienced
it a couple of times already.) If we didn't already have some experience
with Flickr, though, we would probably have been tempted to try SmugMug.
It's a bit more expensive, but it's a stand-alone company and they are
not burdened with Yahoo! accounts; these are infuriating and in my
opinion counts against Flickr.

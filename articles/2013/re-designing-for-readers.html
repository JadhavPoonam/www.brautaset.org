<h1 class="title">Re-designing for readers</h1>
<p>
I enjoyed reading Matt Gemmell's post on <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2013/05/22/designing-blogs-for-readers/">designing blogs for readers</a>
the other week. I decided to see how well my own blog "complies" to
his advice.
</p>

<p>
I have had blogs on wordpress, tumblr and writing my own (terrible)
blog software on a rented VM in the past. This site is a clean break
from those. Content &amp; code both lives in a <a href="http://github.com/stig/superloopy.io">git repository</a>, which
appeals immensely to me as a programmer, and the site is statically
generated and hosted on Github. I don't get the statistics that
Wordpress gives you, and I don't have the seamless posting from
tumblr, but I have full control of the templates &amp; content, and free
custom domains.
</p>

<p>
A lot of blogs seems to focus on style over substance&#x2014;or at least they
make it seem that way&#x2014;with themes that make it very hard to read the
text. Garish background colours; a dazzle of columns; tiny fonts; or, my
current pet peeve, light gray text on white background. These all amount
to punching your readers in the face, and I wanted to avoid that. Thus
this site has a single-column layout, high-contrast theme with fairly
large font size. But my front page wasn't quite right.
</p>

<p>
Instead of the "about me" blurb I used to have I followed Matt's advice
and created a new front page that contains excerpts of the ten most
recent posts. This was made possible by upgrading Jekyll (my blogging
platform) to a new version that automatically grabs the first paragraph
of each post to use for the excerpt. The old front page became the
<a href="file:///about.html">About</a> page instead. Better!
</p>

<p>
The font was already "big enough", I feel, but I shrank the line length
slightly.
</p>

<p>
<i>Update 2013-06-17:</i> According to Google Analytics the bounce rate
dropped by 15&#x2013;20% when the change to the homepage went out. Average
visitor duration went up by about 50%, and average number of pages per
visit went up from below 3 to nearly 4. Not a bad result at all!

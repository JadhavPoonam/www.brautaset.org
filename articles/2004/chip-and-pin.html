<h1 class="title">Chip And Pin</h1>
<p>
I'm getting sick of the British banks' self-gratification. They're
saying that Britain is one of the first countries to make use of this
"new" chip-and-pin system, where you identify yourself by a pin-code
instead of by signature when you're buying goods at shops.
</p>

<p>
What they fail to mention is that they are <i>more than 10 years (at
least) behind other countries</i>. Flashback to Norway 10 years ago, long
before I even thought about moving to Britain. I had a bank account with
a VISA debit card, and <i>I never had to sign</i> when purchasing stuff. I
always tapped in my pin-code.
</p>

<p>
I don't know <i>how much</i> longer they've had that arrangement over there
because I was too young to have a debit card much before that. It was
pretty common to use plastic payment options though, so I imagine it'd
been in place for a while.
</p>

<p>
Ok, I should shut up now. I've ranted enough for one day.

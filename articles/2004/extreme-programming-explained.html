<h1 class="title">Extreme Programming Explained</h1>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Author: Kent Beck</li>
<li>ISBN: 0-201-61641-6</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
Software development projects can be fun, productive, and even daring.
Yet they can consistently deliver value to a business and remain under
control.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The book consists of three main parts made up of 27 chapters, all
crammed into 166 pages (not counting the glossary and index). The first
part explains the problem with current software development practices.
The second part covers how Extreme Programming (XP) provides a solution
to the problem. The third part covers how your team can make the switch
to XP.
</p>

<p>
Beck uses the act of driving a car as a metaphor for the XP software
development process. Carefully pointing a car in the right direction,
locking the steering wheel in a death-grip and flooring the accelerator
is seldom a good way of getting from A to B. Sure, you must have the
"big picture" idea of where you're going and how to get there, but you
should be prepared to apply constant small adjustments to the direction,
brake and accelerator as you go along to make sure you stay on the road.
Additionally, you better be prepared to ask for directions unless you
know <i>exactly</i> where you're going.
</p>

<p>
One concept introduced early on is the four variables of a software
development project: cost, time, quality and scope. To successfully
develop a high-quality project on time and to budget, external forces
(customers and managers) get to decide the value of any three of these
variables and the development team gets to decide the value of the
fourth. Beck explains how quality and time tends to suffer when external
forces get to pick the value of all the four variables, leaving you with
crappy software behind schedule.
</p>

<p>
The importance of testing, refactoring, pair programming and short
release cycles is stressed throughout the book, as is keeping a constant
dialog with the customer. Also covered is how to manage an XP team, as
well as the various "specialist" roles (coach, tracker, tester, etc)
within the team itself.
</p>

<p>
One feeling I am left with after reading this book is that the term
<i>Extreme Programming</i> is a terrible misfit. The term, at least to me,
conjures up an image of tireless programmers holed up in a cave of
computers programming hard &amp; fast for 36 hours a day. However, this is
not at all an accurate image. In my opinion, the processes and concepts
described in this book are better described as <i>Extremely Sensible
Programming</i>. Hardly as catchy though.
</p>

<p>
Should you read this book? Yes, I think so.

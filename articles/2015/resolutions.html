<h1 class="title">2015 Resolutions</h1>
<p>
Happy New Year! The title of this post makes it look like I have a
silly number of resolutions this year, but fear not: I've managed to
limit myself to five. Before getting to them, however, let's first
review how I did on my <a href="file:///Users/stig/blog/articles/2014/resolutions.html">2014 resolutions</a>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>CodeClub: failed! I did however sign up as a STEM Ambassador, and
were in talks with a school to start a club&#x2014;but didn't find a way
to commit the required time.</li>
<li>Lose weight: success! Although I didn't get to 75kg by April, I did
by August&#x2014;and my weight continues to drop. It seems I am able to
<a href="file:///Users/stig/blog/articles/2014/eating-right.html">lose weight by eating right</a>.</li>
<li>Blogging: success! I managed fourteen blog posts last year
(including three on the <a href="http://techblog.net-a-porter.com/author/stig/">company blog</a>) which is one shy of my goal,
but I'm claiming this year's record-length <i>Yuletide</i> letter to family
as my fifteenth.</li>
<li>Socialising: success! Though I didn't manage to arrange a meet with
old friends 12 times last year, as I intended, I'll count this as a
success as I've met up with <i>new</i> friends my son and I have made at
the playpark.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Overall I'm quite pleased. It was a busy year, but one where my health
and wellbeing took a massive turn for the better. I weigh less now than
I've done since I did competetive Judo in my teens.
</p>

<p>
My resolutions for 2015 are to:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Continue writing, but I'll set the bar a little lower this year:
twelve posts on this blog.</li>
<li>Improve my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/5950/stig-brautaset">StackOverflow reputation</a> from current 1808 to at
least 2500.</li>
<li>Continue learning Clojure (a Lisp targetting the JVM) by writing a
web application and getting at least ten users.</li>
<li>Make an attempt at improving my guitar playing by going through the
first ten chapters of <a href="http://www.noad.com/SGP1ndx.html">Solo Guitar Playing</a> by Frederick Noad.</li>
<li>Go hiking in Northumberland and camp out at least once.</li>
</ol>

<p>
All realistic &amp; achievable goals, I think, but not without putting in a
little effort. I am looking forward to the challenge! Please do feel
free to prod me about progress on any of these!

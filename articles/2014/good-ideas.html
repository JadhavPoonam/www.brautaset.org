<h1 class="title">Good Ideas</h1>
<p>
I mentioned in private conversation recently that I would like to work
on making the world a better place. In response I was asked "what does
<i>better</i> mean to you?" which sort of perplexed me&#x2014;it had never occured
to me to try to define it. So in this post I'll present a few Good Ideas
I believe is making (or will make) the world a better place.
</p>

<p>
<b>Affordable education.</b> I strongly believe that free education is not
only <i>right</i>&#x2014;it is also a sound <i>investment against future taxes</i>.
Higher education tends to lead to higher salaries, thus a higher
educated population ends up paying more tax through their working life.
</p>

<p>
<b>Equal and generous parental leave.</b> When parental leave is taken wholly
or mostly by mothers they tend to be overlooked for promotion and pay
rises, or discriminated against when applying for jobs. But when men
<i>also</i> can take up to six months leave, women get more protection
against discrimination. There are also indications that families where
dad take a more active role in child rearing tends to divorce less
frequently. Thus, equality with regards to parental leave leads to fewer
broken homes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Unconditional basic income.</b> Let's replace all benefits with a
guaranteed basic income for all citizens. I believe this will become a
necessity as more and more jobs are being automated away. When mining
machines took over the dangerous jobs miners were doing I don't think
the they were sorry they couldn't go back&#x2014;though many were surely
distraught that they couldn't support their families any more. If they
had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income">basic income</a> to fall back on, less problems could have been the
result. Of course it's not a complete solution. Not everyone (myself
included) will be content with devoting ourselves to art &amp; culture, so
will need to find new things to do. But I believe it's a start:
particularly when coupled with free education.
</p>

<p>
<b>Self-driving cars.</b> I'm optimistic about this, and I hope that my son
never has to learn to drive. Traffic accidents are apparently now the
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/may/02/traffic-accidents-biggest-killer-young-people">biggest killer of young people worldwide</a>. Of course most of the deaths
is in developing countries, which will likely not be the first to
adopt self-driving cars, but one has to start somewhere. This might
incidentally be a catalyst for unconditional basic income due to job
losses from self-driving lorries, cabs, and busses.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tax oil and tobacco companies to within an inch of their
profitability.</b> (Or beyond.) It is not right that a few companies
should be allowed to get absurdly rich by plundering the planet's last
reserves of non-renewable natural resources. Neither is it right that
companies peddling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_tobacco">the single greatest cause of preventable death
globally</a> should be allowed to reap astronomical profits from it.
</p>

<p>
I don't think any of this is a pipe dream. Most of the above ideas are
<i>already</i> implemented in various parts of the world. For example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In Scotland&#x2014;as it is throughout Scandinavia&#x2014;education is already
essentially free, if you exclude living costs.</li>

<li>In Norway parental leave is 46 weeks at 100% pay, or optionally 56
weeks at 80% pay. Of this 12 weeks is reserved for the father and
<i>cannot be transferred to the mother</i>. According to this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/world/europe/10iht-sweden.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">NY Times
article</a> Sweden has a similar scheme.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.tobaccoatlas.org/solutions/tobacco_taxes/excise_tax/">Cuba, UK and Egypt</a> are in the lead on the taxation of tobacco. (But
probably not by enough.)</li>

<li>Norway <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Norway#Taxation_of_petroleum_activities">tax petroleum extraction at 78%</a>. The proceeds is put into a
fund, and invested for the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Unconditional basic income is unfortunately not a reality yet. Though
it <i>has</i> seen successful small-scale trials in several countries and
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/04/us-swiss-pay-idUSBRE9930O620131004">Switzerland</a> will apparently be voting on whether to introduce it
nationwide in not too long. Finally, Ford predicts <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/132147-ford-self-driving-cars-2017">self driving cars
by 2017</a>.

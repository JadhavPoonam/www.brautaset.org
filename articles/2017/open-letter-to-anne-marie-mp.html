<span class="subtitle">How are the Conservatives "working for everyone"?</span>
</h1>
<div class="abstract">
<p>
I ask how the Conservatives can say they are "working for everyone"
whilst giving extra tax breaks and benefits to the 15% of top earners,
and at the same time cutting benefits for the poor.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Dear <a href="https://www.teamtrevelyan.co.uk/">Anne-Marie</a>,
</p>

<p>
I live in your constituency and I have a question.
</p>

<p>
I am wondering how the Conservatives can say you are "working for
everyone" whilst giving the 15% of top earners<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> a tax break <i>5
times</i> the size of low earners<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>? How is it fair that people on
minimum wage should only get a £100 tax break but those who earn more
than £45,000 gets a £500 tax break?
</p>

<p>
Now consider the ISA offerings you bumped the limits of to £20,000 per
year. It would <i>technically</i> be possible to get this benefit if you earn
£25,000 per year&#x2014;assuming you live for free, eat for free, and spend
no more than 75 pence per day<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. Yet, the median salary in this
country is roughly £21,000 before tax<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>, which means half the
population cannot possibly get this full benefit even if they save <i>all</i>
their earnings. You need to be among the top 10% of higher
earners&#x2014;which means you have a salary of more than
£35,345<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>&#x2014;to have a fighting chance of making the full use of
this benefit. It is clear that this is not a benefit for everyone, but
for the few: the elite.
</p>

<p>
To finance these tax cuts and benefits for high earners you cut
benefits to the poorest and most vulnerable in this country. You're
cutting the Employment Support Allowance (ESA) by £29/week. You're
cutting child tax credits, worth £545 per year. Further you are
freezing benefits, including JSA, ESA, child benefits and some housing
benefit payments<sup><a id="fnr.2.100" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. All the while a rising number of people are
reaching out to food banks to make ends meet<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
The Conservatives say you are "working for everyone". It's time you
start acting like it.
</p>

<p>

Personal allowance increased from £11,000 to £11,500, which
equals a £100 tax break. But the 40% rate of tax will move from

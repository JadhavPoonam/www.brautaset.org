<p>
A short experience report about blogging with Org mode.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Since <a href="blogging-with-org-mode.html">changing my blog to use Emacs' Org mode</a> rather than Jekyll one
month ago I've written four posts. (This will be the fifth.) In
comparison, through all of 2016 I managed seven posts; and only five
in all of 2015. I consider this increase is a minor success, though
whether it is because it's so much easier to blog now, or whether I've
just got more to say I don't know. So let's examine recent posts.
</p>

<p>
The first post after the switch is the one referenced above <i>describing</i>
the switch. All the material came from the switch itself, but it also
includes lots of code examples for different languages that are very
easy to create / maintain with Org mode.
</p>

<p>
The next post is my call for <a href="electoral-reform-now.html">Electoral Reform</a>. It has a massive table
in it, which was easy to create &amp; manipulate with Org mode&#x2014;but there
is no way I would have even attempted that with Markdown / Jekyll.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="n-queens.html">N Queens</a> post has some graphics generated with <a href="http://ditaa.sourceforge.net">ditaa</a>&#x2014;from the
<a href="https://github.com/stig/stig.github.com/blob/master/articles/2017/n-queens.org#L43%0A">ASCII-art embedded in the source</a> of the post. I could perhaps have
created the graphics separately, but it's much more likely that I
would not create the post, or create it without the graphics. I think
the post is richer for the graphics. It also has lots of code
examples, and again Org shines here.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="potter-coding-dojo.html">Potter Coding Dojo</a> post is another one full of code examples, but
it also contains a local table of contents, auto-generated by Org
mode. It also uses footnotes, which you don't get for free with
Markdown/Jekyll. Other Org features that enhances this post are tables
and use of \(\LaTeX{}\) formulas.
</p>

<p>
I've discovered that I much prefer initiating the publishing step from
within Emacs rather than with the <code>build.el</code> script, so yesterday I
changed to use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html">directory-local variables</a> to set the publishing project
for my blog. This also improves the syntax highlighting of code
examples. It appears that when running in script mode code examples
are syntax-highlighted as when Emacs runs in a terminal, and this is
<i>much</i> inferior to when Emacs runs as a GUI.
</p>

<p>
I conclude that switching to Org mode has been an enabler for my
blogging, and I'm happy with the switch.

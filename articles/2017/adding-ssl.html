<h1 class="title">Adding SSL to this Blog</h1>
<div class="abstract">
<p>
I outline the steps I plan to take to add SSL to this blog, leveraging
AWS Certificate Manager, CloudFront, S3 and Route 53. (And potentially
CloudFormation.)
</p>

</div>
<p>
Because this is basic static site I've not previously bothered with
SSL. But as <a href="https://www.mnot.net/blog/2014/01/04/strengthening_http_a_personal_view">Chrome and Firefox will require HTTP/2 requests to be
encrypted</a>, and with <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure">Chrome marking HTTP as non-secure</a>, I figure it's
time to do something about that.
</p>

<p>
GitHub Pages, where this site is currently hosted, regretfully <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156">doesn't
support HTTPS for custom domains</a>. (It does, however, support it for
<a href="https://github.com/blog/2186-https-for-github-pages"><code>$username.github.io</code></a> domains.) At work I was recently pleasantly
surprised how convenient Amazon Certificate Manager &amp; CloudFront is
for obtaining &amp; deploying certificates, and I thought I would use that
for this project. I also want to do this with CloudFormation, so I
have a repeatable setup at the end. (I have a couple other sites that
can benefit from SSL too.)
</p>

<p>
For hosting the content there's a couple different approaches I could
take:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Continuing to publish static HTML to stig.github.io and use that
as the Origin</li>
<li>Publish static HTML to S3 and use <i>that</i> as the Origin</li>
</ol>
<p>
Since I no longer use Jekyll but check in generated files, switching
to publishing them to S3 instead is my preferred option.
</p>

<p>
There is an additional issue to solve. I want the Apex domain (i.e.
superloopy.io) redirecting to www.superloopy.io. This is currently
handled by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/">GitHub</a>, but I would like to use S3 to handle this
redirection, as outlined in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html">Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3</a>.
However, you cannot CNAME the Apex domain to an S3 bucket&#x2014;as
required by that approach&#x2014;unless you rely on Amazon Route 53 for
your DNS needs. So the <i>first</i> part of this project will probably be to
delegate<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> my DNS to Route 53.
</p>

<p>
Thus, a plan emerges:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a href="route-53-cloudformation.html">Manage DNS for superloopy.io with AWS Route 53</a></li>
<li><a href="ssl-enabled-s3-redirects-with-cloudformation.html">Handle redirects from Apex domain to www with an S3 bucket</a></li>
<li>Change my blog publishing setup to populate an S3 bucket</li>
<li>Serve my blog from this S3 bucket, using CloudFront to deploy an
ACM-provided cert</li>
</ol>

<p>
One thing I have in abundant supply is lack of time, so I'm afraid
those steps will have to be the subject of future posts.
</p>
<div id="footnotes"><!--Footnotes-->
<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.1" class="footnum" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
I don't want to transfer the actual domain, at least yet, as
I've been happy with Gandi for many years and they are a bit cheaper
than AWS for <code>.io</code> domains.

<h1 class="title">Overcoming RSI</h1>
<div class="abstract">
<p>
Early 2005 I encountered a bad bout of RSI. Prompted by a comment on
the Lobsters forum, I thought I'd share my experience.
</p>

</div>
<p>
I came across <a href="https://boinkor.net/2016/04/some-things-i-learned-about-dealing-with-rsi/">this story</a> about overcoming RSI and thought I'd share my
experience in <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/qaeig8/some_things_i_learned_about_dealing_with_rsi">the comments</a> on Lobsters. When that turned out blog-post
length, I thought I'd post it here too.
</p>

<p>
I had a terribly scary run-in with RSI about 20 months into my working
career, or about 2 months into my new job. Like the author, I had it
bad: I found it excruciatingly painful to open doors, or do pretty much
anything. In the evenings I would sit in front of the TV with a pillow
in my lap, resting my hands on the pillow&#x2014;that too would be painful.
Even resting my hands on the top of the duvet in bed was painful.
</p>

<p>
I seriously considered leaving IT, but I persevered as I couldn't
think of anything I'd want to do that didn't involve a lot of typing.
(Even going back to study would require quite a lot of typing.) So I
talked to my boss, who I knew had also struggled with RSI
periodically. He gave the same advice as <a href="https://lobste.rs/c/9qexwc">@kel</a>: change things up. That
was 11 years ago, and I guess it was sage advice because I am still
programming, but mostly pain free these days.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the wrist pains, that went all the way up to the elbow
and beyond (on the left) I had other symptoms. One of the most
persistent ones is that my fingertips, and the first joint on the
fingers, would have stabbing pains from pressing the keys.
</p>

<p>
Some things that helped me, <i>probably</i> in order of importance:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Throw away the wrist rest. "Resting" my wrists on a gel-pad while
typing constricted the blood vessels just under the skin, and made me
prone to bending the wrists to read far-away keys rather than moving
my whole arm from the shoulder. This was possibly the hardest, but
most effective thing I did: learn to type without resting my forearms
on the table / wrist rest.</li>
<li>Getting a proper external split keyboard. The first two months at
that job I was typing on the laptop keyboard. (Macbook Pro.) I
switched to using a Microsoft split keyboard for a while, but I
found the keys too hard to press down. I soon moved to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fujitsu-Keyboard-KBPC-keyboards-CSA-C22-2/dp/B000JWEJEC?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=siemens%20keyboard&amp;qid=1455117950&amp;ref_=sr_1_2&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-2">Fujitsu
Siemens Butterfly</a> one and haven't looked back. A split keyboard
allows a much more normal position of my arms, leading to more
natural positions of the wrists. (For me, at least.)</li>
<li>I joined a gym (lucky me: work sponsored gym membership across the
road) and worked on upper back and arm strength to improve my posture
and have the strength to let my underarms hover over the table rather
than resting on it the whole day. (See the first point.)</li>
<li>Pair programming. My team was very understanding. We did a lot of
pairing, though not on everything, and I probably ended up pairing
more during this process. On days when my RSI was very bad I would
sometimes be doing the driving, but without holding the keyboard. I
am forever grateful to my very understanding colleagues. (Who were
all senior to me.)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Some things that didn't help:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I could not switch to Dvorak layout, because I was already using it.
I now wonder if that hid my symptoms for a while, until it got
completely out of hand? Who knows. It's anyway the only way I can
touch type. (Because if I look at the keys I just get confused: they
don't type what they say on them.)</li>
<li>Taking holidays. I took a two-week break from touching a computer,
and felt absolutely fine. However, within minutes of sitting down in
front of a keyboard my hands were in agony again. That was not a
great day.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It took months getting over the pain. For a long time fear of the pain
itself probably caused me to tense up and make things worse than they
could have been. But, with the help of an understanding boss I did
eventually manage to get back to a pain-free existence.
</p>

<p>
Over the years since I have had bouts with RSI again, sometimes very
bad, but I now know that I don't need to panic. I <i>do</i> need to double
down on discipline though.

<p>
I remember laughing very hard at a comic-book joke as a kid. A red
indian with horrific injuries goes to visit his witch-doctor:
</p>

<p class="verse">
&#x2014; What brought this on?<br>
&#x2014; I was out hunting when an eagle attacked me, but luckily it dropped me in front of a flock of runaway buffallo!<br>
&#x2014; Luckily?<br>
&#x2014; Yes, it's the only thing my medical insurance covers!<br>
</p>

<p>
I used to find it hilarious back then, but having now started looking
into insurance I realize that the joke's on me, and I don't find it so
funny anymore. Here's an exerpt from the exclusion clause in Abbey's
accident cover:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We will not pay benefits for an accident that is directly or
indirectly the result of:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>war, invasion, acts of foreign enemies, civil war, rebellion, or
being on naval, military or air force duty, service or operations;</li>
<li>riding a motorcycle or moped as a driver or passenger;</li>
<li>scuba-diving, rock climbing or mountaineering of any type,
potholing or parachuting;</li>
<li>competing in any race other than on foot or whilst swimming;</li>
<li>exposure to exceptional danger (except in an attempt to save human
life);</li>
<li>the manufacture or use of explosives;</li>
<li>flying except as a fare paying passenger;</li>
<li>your suicide, your own illegal acts, your intentional
self-inflicted injury, whether you are sane or insane;</li>
<li>being under the influence of or being affected by alcohol or drugs
unless under the advice of a doctor for a conditon other than
alcohol or drug addiction;</li>
<li>radiaton or contamination or the effects of radiation;</li>
<li>HIV, AIDS or any related condition or disease</li>
<li>you having any sickness, disease, naturally occurring condition,
injury or degenerative process.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the poor red indian in the joke above had had this insurance, I'm
pretty sure the cretins would have managed to weazel their way out of
paying for his claim.

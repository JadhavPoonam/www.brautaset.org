<p>
A while back I wrote a basic Neural Net class in Objective-C, and tested
it pretty well. Or, so I thought. The net was a bit slow at calculating
output, so I decided to rewrite it. I had originally used Objective-C
arrays for simplicity, but they were hurting performance so I decided to
swap its implementation for C arrays instead. However, my test suite had
poked inside the internals of the class, so at every step I was now
having to rewrite the tests as I was rewriting the internals of the
class I was testing. I did this to keep the interface small, but it was
really biting me in the ass now.
</p>

<p>
I ended up reverting all the changes I had made and completely rewriting
the test suite to only use the provided interface of the class, adding
to the interface as needed. After cleaning up the test suite (this had
the unforseen side-effect of making the interface a lot nicer to work
with) I rewrote the internals as I had planned and managed to get a
five-fold speed increase, without changing any of the tests at all.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lesson learned:</b> don't be afraid to enrich your interface if it makes
your code easier to test.

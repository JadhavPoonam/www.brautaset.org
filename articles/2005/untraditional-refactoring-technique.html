<h1 class="title">Untraditional Refactoring Technique</h1>
<p>
Bizzarely, today I found myself deleting a test script preparing to
refactor the code it tested. Really.
</p>

<p>
Before you proceed to tear your hair out, let me just say that it's not
actually as crazy as it sounds, however. The project in question is a
forked and cut-down version of a project with much wider scope.
Therefore it has lots of code in it that is not exercised by the
consumers of the API it provides, but only of its own tests.
</p>

<p>
The particular test I deleted was checking to see whether all the Perl
modules in the project actually compiles. By removing it we can simply
prune modules that are not even loaded off disk. The test coverage
report I'm going by is produced by running the project's unit-tests as
well as running all the other individual projects against it. Our build
system checks all of these out of subversion for the builds, hence I
could not simply omit to run the offending test.
</p>

<p>
OK, so this is not <i>really</i> a refactoring, but simply a way of deleting
dead code. Refactoring is a <i>much</i> hotter buzzword though, so I wanted
to squeeze it into the title of this post somehow. Once the effort of
removing the dead code is over I'll add the test back in.

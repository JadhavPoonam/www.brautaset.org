<h1 class="title">Quiet Please</h1>
<p>
In January I bought a guitar and a small practice amp. As I noted back
then the amp has lots of effects which saves me buying an array of
pedals. It has one problem though: it is very loud. And by that I
don't mean that it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven">goes to 11</a>, but that it goes from zero to hero
already around 2: below is too quiet, above too high, and the optimal
setting in the middle is too hard to find.
</p>

<p>
There's simply not enough (useable) dynamic range. I could turn down the
input volume from my guitar, but that changes the sound unfavourably (I
get lower signal-to-noise ratio, and many of the effects rely on high
input level to work satisfactorily).
</p>

<p>
To solve the problem I measured the resistance through the speaker to
6.2 Ohms, hooked a 57.4 Ohm resistor in series with it (for a total of
63.6 Ohms) and a 8.2 Ohm resistor in parallel with that. Substituting
63.6 and 8.2 for R1 and R2 in <code>1/R1 + 1/R2 = 1/R</code>, the formula for
calculating the combined resistance in a parallel circuit, and solving
for R gives a combined resistance of about 7.3&#x2014;close enough for my
purposes.
</p>

<p>
The result? Most of the output from the amp now bypass the actual
speaker, shunted off into a resistor where it is converted to heat
rather than sound; the volume dial has a much greater effective range,
making it much easier to adjust to a sensible level; and my neighbours
are much happier.

<h1 class="title">Little Brother</h1>
<p>
<a href="http://craphound.com/littlebrother">Little Brother</a> by Cory Doctorow is a whirlwind of a novel,
downloadable in various electronic formats from the author's website.
This book should be compulsory reading in schools. Actually&#x2014;scratch
that. It should be compulsory reading for <i>everyone</i>.
</p>

<p>
Here's the lowdown:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Marcus, a.k.a “w1n5t0n,” is only seventeen years old, but he figures
he already knows how the system works&#x2013;and how to work the system.
Smart, fast, and wise to the ways of the networked world, he has no
trouble outwitting his high school's intrusive but clumsy surveillance
systems.
</p>

<p>
But his whole world changes when he and his friends find themselves
caught in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack on San Francisco.
In the wrong place at the wrong time, Marcus and his crew are
apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security and whisked away to
a secret prison where they're mercilessly interrogated for days.
</p>

<p>
When the DHS finally releases them, Marcus discovers that his city has
become a police state where every citizen is treated like a potential
terrorist. He knows that no one will believe his story, which leaves
him only one option: to take down the DHS himself.
</p>
</blockquote>

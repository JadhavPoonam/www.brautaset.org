Why this site is moving from www.superloopy.io to www.brautaset.org.
#+end_abstract

I've decided to end the experiment with a separate vanity domain
(superloopy.io) for this site. =.io= domains are expensive, and I don't
want to pay for one any longer. And more to the point, I don't want to
pay for more than one private vanity domain, and I've been using the
brautaset.org domain for my email for two decades so it was a pretty
easy choice to keep that one.

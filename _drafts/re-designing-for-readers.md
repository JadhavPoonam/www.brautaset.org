title: Re-designing for readers
layout: post
---

I enjoyed reading Matt Gemmell's post on [designing blogs for
readers](http://mattgemmell.com/2013/05/22/designing-blogs-for-readers/) the other week. I
decided to see how well my own blog "complies" to his advice.

I have had blogs on wordpress, tumblr and running my own (terrible) blog software on a
bytemark VM in the past. This current site is a clean break. It's statically generated,
hosted on Github, and I have full control of the templates. I don't get the statistics
that wordpress.com gives, but I have free custom domain. I don't have the seamless posting
from tumblr, but I do have full revision history. Content & code both lives in a git
repository, which appeals immensely to me as a programmer.

This site has never had sidebars and actually already had a fairly clean layout, but my
front page wasn't quite right. I renamed the existing front page to [About](/about.html),
and created a new front page that contains excerpts of the ten most recent posts. This was
made possible by upgrading Jekyll (my blogging platform) to version 1.0. It automatically
grabs the first paragraph of each post to use for the excerpt.

Large-ish fonts is also something this blog has had "forever".

My wife and I are big fans of “ToddlerCalm: A guide for calmer toddlers
and happier parents” by Sarah Ockwell-Smith. It is available for
[Kindle](http://www.amazon.co.uk/ToddlerCalm-calmer-toddlers-happier-parents-ebook/dp/B00CQ5R186/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1394282509&sr=1-1&keywords=toddlercalm)
and
[paperback](http://www.amazon.co.uk/ToddlerCalm-calmer-toddlers-happier-parents/dp/0349401055/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1394282509&sr=1-1).
We also attended a 
[ToddlerCalm 3-hour workshop](http://toddlercalm.co.uk/pages/parent_classes.html). This post talks a
little about some of the key things that helped us from that.

Our session was led by clinical child psychologist Victoria
Montgomery. (I believe it was £35 for the wife and I.) We have found
this absolutely invaluable in helping us understand what our son is
going through (and thus how to deal with him) growing up.

The book (& course) did teach us some tricks for “how to deal with
tantrums” but more than anything it helped us understand what we can
expect from him at his age, and thus we know not to expect too
much. You’d be surprised how much more you can handle of particular
behaviours if you know that it is perfectly normal (despite what
others say!) :-)


Our (or at least my) biggest issue was night-time sleep, or lack of
it. He doesn't go to sleep much earlier now, but we've managed to be
less stressed about it so it doesn't bother us so much. And I suppose
we are blessed in that he sleeps in quite long when he finally goes to
bed!

We used to be a bit stressed about meals, particularly lack of a
“balanced diet” but we didn't want to force him to eat (I have only in
the last few years overcome some of my own food hang ups) so we did
some research and it turns out lots of tribes eat incredibly unvaried
diets (Eskimos eat fish and sealfat almost exclusively; no veg at
all!) and they are healthy. So we learnt to just let him eat what he
want (within limits) when he wanted. We also reasoned that we have
evolved to graze (we doubt stone-age man had three square meals a day,
with no snack in between) so we offer fruits and berries liberally.

We have found he goes through phases food wise. He refused anything
green for a while, but at the moment broccoli is one of his
favourites. He also will sometimes not eat things if they are mixed
together, but will wolf them down separately.

By the way, we have recently cut out all grains (in particular wheat
and oats) from our diet and although our son was not particularly
difficult to start with the transformation is incredible. He's so much
more calm now, particularly around bedtime. As a bonus, my wife and I are
losing weight and having more energy too!

This is a list of some of my talks & articles hosted elsewhere:

- [Delighting your users with SBJson 4](https://vimeo.com/86478323) (2013)
<br/>
This is my first *Pecha Kucha* style talk, made at NSLondon meetup.
The sound is regretfully not great, and one of my slides is a bit
misleading, but I have a special fondness for this one as it's the
first time I've been invited to speak.

- [Overcoming U-turns and Dead Ends: Lessons of using Scala, Akka & Spray on Heroku](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/overcoming-u-turns-and-dead-ends-lessons-of-using-scala-akka-spray-on-heroku) (2013)
<br/>
I presented this "experience talk" at Scala eXchange 2013 with Sam
Dean. (I'm afraid you have to log in to view the video.) It's a
mish-mash of stuff we learnt while building the backend of The
Netbook---Net-A-Porter's social network offering.

- [Testing C with Libtap](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/01/19/libtap.html?CMP=OTC-6YE827253101&ATT=Testing+C+with+Libtap) (2006)
<br/>
I talked at YAPC::NA 2005 (I believe) on this topic and was approached
by a member of the audience to write it up as an article for ONLamp
magazine. This is the result.

- [Creating HTML with M4](http://www.linux-magazine.com/w3/issue/25/GNUm4.pdf#!) (200?)
<br/>
A long, long time ago I used *make* and *cpp* to maintain my website.
Later I upgraded to *m4*. I ended up writing an article on the
subject, and this was published in Linux Magazine.

- My [Net-a-Porter Techblog entries](http://techblog.net-a-porter.com/author/stig/) (2013-2014)
<br/>
I wrote a few entries on the Net-a-Porter tech blog
in my various roles there. (Details about my roles on my linkedin
profile.)

This is a list of some of my talks & articles hosted elsewhere:

- [My Net-a-Porter Techblog entries (2013--2014)](http://techblog.net-a-porter.com/author/stig/)

  I wrote a few entries on the Net-a-Porter tech blog in my various roles
  there. (Details about my roles on my linkedin profile.)

- [Delighting your users with SBJson 4 (2013)](https://vimeo.com/86478323)

  This is my first _Pecha Kucha_ style talk, made at NSLondon meetup. The
  sound is not great, and one of my slides is a bit misleading, but I have a
  special fondness for this one as it's the first time I've been invited to
  speak.

- [Overcoming U-turns and Dead Ends: Lessons of using Scala, Akka & Spray on Heroku (2013)](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/overcoming-u-turns-and-dead-ends-lessons-of-using-scala-akka-spray-on-heroku)

  I presented this "experience talk" at Scala eXchange 2013 with Sam
  Dean. (I'm afraid you have to log in to view the video.) It's a
  mish-mash of stuff we learnt while building the backend of The
  Netbook---Net-A-Porter's social network offering.

- [Testing C with Libtap (2006)](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/01/19/libtap.html?CMP=OTC-6YE827253101&ATT=Testing+C+with+Libtap)

  I talked at YAPC::NA 2005 (I believe) on this topic and was approached by a
  member of the audience to write it up as an article for ONLamp magazine.
  This is the result.

- [Creating HTML with M4 (2002)](files/m4.pdf)

  A long, long time ago I used `make` and `cpp` to maintain my website. Later
  I upgraded to `m4`. I ended up writing an article on the subject, and this
  was published in Linux Magazine.

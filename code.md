My [GitHub profile](http://github.com/stig) lists many software projects; some of which
may be useful to you. (Though most probably are not.) You are welcome to make use of
these, for free, as long as you adhere to their respective licenses. For the ones provided
under a BSD, this means that you have to attribute me in your application.

# Using code without attribution

I understand that putting an attribution in your application can sometimes be a problem.
I've set up an [online store][] where you can buy a Non-Attribution License for selected
software packages. These lets you use the relevant source code package in your application
without attribution.

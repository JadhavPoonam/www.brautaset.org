#+title: About

I grew up in Hovdebygda, a village in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98rsta][Ørsta Municipality]] on the west
coast of Norway. I studied Electronics in Ørsta, Ålesund & Oslo. After
interrupting my studies by compulsory military service I moved to
London to study Artificial Intelligence at Westminster University
in 2000. I still live in England, though in March 2015 I moved from
London to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berwick-upon-Tweed][Berwick-upon-Tweed]].

I have worked in software development since I graduated in 2003. Over the
years employers have paid me to write HTML, PHP, Perl, C, JavaScript, Java,
Objective-C, Scala, Python, Bash and English.

I have accounts on more sites than I can remember. Most are in varying
states of lacking attention. Here are some:

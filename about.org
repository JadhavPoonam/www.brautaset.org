#+title: About Stig Brautaset

I'm a software engineer living near [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berwick-upon-Tweed][Berwick-upon-Tweed]], in the
northeast of England. I've previously worked in London and Hong Kong;
I now work remotely. Employers have paid me to write HTML, PHP, Perl,
C, JavaScript, Java, Objective-C, Scala, Python, Bash and English.

I'm originally from Hovdebygda, in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98rsta][Ã˜rsta]], on the west coast of Norway.
I studied electronics and endured compulsory military service as a
sonar operator on a submarine, before moving to London to study AI at
the University of Westminster. I graduated in 2003.

I started writing the popular [[https://github.com/stig/json-framework/][SBJson]] JSON parser/generator for
Objective-C in 2007, and have maintained it ever since. It's now in
its 5th major version and have over 3800 stars on GitHub.

#+title: About Stig Brautaset

I've lived and worked remotely from rural [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berwick-upon-Tweed][Berwick-upon-Tweed]] in the
North East of England since 2015. I've previously lived in London
(about 14 years) and Hong Kong (1 year). Employers have paid me to
write HTML, PHP, Perl, C, JavaScript, Java, Objective-C, Scala,
Python, Bash and English.

I grew up in Hovdebygda, a village in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98rsta][Ã˜rsta Municipality]] on the west
coast of Norway. At 16 I started studying electronics for five years,
then endured compulsory military service as a sonar operator on a
submarine. I studied AI University of Westminster (London, UK) where I
graduated in 2003.

I started writing the moderately popular [[https://github.com/stig/json-framework/][SBJson]] JSON parser/generator
for Objective-C in 2007, and have maintained it ever since. It's now
in its 5th major version and have over 3800 stars on GitHub.

  Amazon S3 behind a CloudFront distribution and a free SSL

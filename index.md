I make software for fun and profit. 2013 will mark my ten year anniversary for writing
software for a living. In the past I've been paid to write PHP, Perl & JavaScript; while
in my current job I write Java, Scala & Objective-C. They also pay me to think about
architecture and APIs a lot.

I'm Norwegian and a Londoner; I have lived here since 2000. (Except for a gap year in Hong
Kong.) I have profiles on various sites all over the web, including these:

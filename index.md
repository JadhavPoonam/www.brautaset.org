title: The Other Stig
---

I make software for fun and profit. 2013 will mark my ten year anniversary for writing
software for a living.  In my current job I write Java, Scala & Objective-C; and think
about architecture and APIs a lot.

I'm from Norway, but have lived in London since 2000. (Except for a year in Hong Kong
during parts of 2011 and 2012.) I have profiles on various sites all over the web,
including these:

* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/stigbra)
* [Github](http://github.com/stig)
* [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/stigbrautaset)
* [Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/stigbra)
* [Masterbranch](http://www.masterbranch.com/developer/stig.brautaset)

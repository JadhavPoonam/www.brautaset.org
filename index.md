I make software for fun and profit.

My [GitHub profile](http://github.com/stig) lists some software packages
that may be useful to you. (And some that probably aren't.) You are welcome
to make use of these, for free, as long as you adhere to their respective
licenses. For the ones provided under a BSD, this means that you have to
attribute me in your application. (See below how you can get around that.)

# Using my code without attribution

Many of my source code packages requires attribution. However, I
understand that putting an attribution in your application can sometimes
be a problem. I've set up an [online store][] where you can buy a
Non-Attribution License for selected software packages. These lets you
use the relevant source code package in your application without
attribution.

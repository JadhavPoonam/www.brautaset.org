I make software for fun and profit. 2013 will mark my ten year anniversary for writing
software for a living. In my current job I write Java, Scala & Objective-C. They also pay
me to think about architecture and APIs a lot.

I am Norwegian but also consider myself a Londoner. I have lived here since September
2000, except for a short stint in Hong Kong.

I have profiles on various sites all over the web, including these:

* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/stigbra)
* [Github](http://github.com/stig)
* [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/stigbrautaset)
* [Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/stigbra)
* [Masterbranch](http://www.masterbranch.com/developer/stig.brautaset)

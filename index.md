# Maker of free software

My [GitHub profile](http://github.com/stig) lists some of the software
packages that may be useful for other people. (And some that probably
aren't.) You are welcome to make use of these, for free, as long as you
adhere to their respective licenses. For the ones provided under a BSD,
this means that you have to attribute me in your application. (See below
how you can get around that.)

# Using my code without attribution

Many of my source code packages requires attribution. However, I
understand that putting an attribution in your application can sometimes
be a problem. I've set up an [online store][] where you can buy a
Non-Attribution License for selected software packages. These lets you
use the relevant source code package in your application without
attribution.

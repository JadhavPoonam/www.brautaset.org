I'm not lost, Shirley, I can spot my room at, um, at least 50 paces.

Decided to tidy up some of the cabling mess in my room. It looks a lot neater now, and I
can actually see the floor where there earlier was just a huge bundle (or pile, rather) of
cables.

Dell repairman came around and gave me the second new keyboard for one of my laptops. He
was very baffled that I had managed to wear out the `CAPS_LOCK` key since April, which is
the last time I got a new keyboard for it. What I didn't tell him was that I remap the
`CAPS_LOCK` key to Control :P

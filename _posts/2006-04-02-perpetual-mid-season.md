Sainsbury's were out of their nice orange juice so we had to buy Tropicana instead. Eating
breakfast and reading the back of the carton I found this:

> So every day a mile long Tropicana train travels over a thousand miles from lush, green
> groves to New York laden with just-squeezed juice. Naturally pure, and squeezed from
> only the choicest oranges, each one handpicked at its mid-season best.

How curious. That is either a very liberal use of the word "just" or those green groves
have *remarkably*  short pre and post seasons.

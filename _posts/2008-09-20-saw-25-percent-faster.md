title: Saw 25% faster!
---
Today I bought a new saw at the local hardware store. It's an [Irwin Universal 880 Triple
Ground](http://www.irwin.dk/pdf/IR_JA_LIT_KFS_880_300dpi_4C.pdf) handsaw. It, as the name
suggests, features a new triple ground tooth design that makes it *25% faster* than the
double ground version. It was pretty cheap too, at &pound;7.99.

I was quite excited about it, but felt a bit sheepish&mdash;like I was exploring an
entirely new ballpark of sadness&mdash;until I actually tried the thing. It's a *delight*
to use compared to my old saw. It cut through my chip-wood shelf like a knife through hot
butter.

Ok, still feeling *a little* bit bad about being so excited about a saw. I'm sure I'll get
over it.

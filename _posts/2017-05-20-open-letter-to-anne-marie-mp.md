title: How are the Conservatives "working for everyone"?

Dear Anne-Marie,

I live in your constituency and I have a question.

I am wondering how the Conservatives can say you are "working for
everyone" whilst giving the 15% of top earners<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> a tax break *5
times* the size of low earners<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>? How is it fair that people on
minimum wage should only get a £100 tax break but those who earn many
times more should get a £500 tax break?

High earners already have lots of benefits. Take for example the ISA
offerings you bumped the limits of to £20,000/year. It would
*technically* be possible to get this benefit if you earn £25,000 per
year&#x2014;assuming you live for free, eat for free, and spend no more
than 75 pence per day<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. Yet, the median salary in this country is
roughly £21,000 before tax<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>, which means half the population
cannot possibly get this full benefit even if they put *all* their
earnings in. You need to be among the top 10% of higher earners, which
means you have a salary of more than £35,345<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>, to have a fighting
chance of making the full use of this benefit. This shows that this
is really a benefit for the few: the elite.

To finance this furthering of tax cut and savings benefit for high
earners you cut benefits to the poorest and most vulnerable in this
country. You're cutting the Employment Support Allowance (ESA) by
£29/week. You're cutting child tax credits, worth £545 per year.
Further you are freezing benefits, including JSA, ESA, child benefits
and some housing benefit payments<sup><a id="fnr.2.100" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. All the while a rising number
of people are reaching out to food banks to make ends meet<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>.

The Conservatives say you are "working for everyone". It's time you
start acting like it.

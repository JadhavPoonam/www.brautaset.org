title: What I want for my Birthday

According to the [World Land Trust](http://worldlandtrust.org), citing [The
Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/), Britons last year spent £3.6 billion on food,
healthcare and accessories for their pets. I realise that pets have to eat and that the
occasional visit to the vet is in order, but a shocking £294 million alone was spent on
*pet gifts*.

I am saddened and distraught by this mindless waste; to put it in perspective, £294
million could save *20 million acres* of Rainforest. That's more than a third of what is
cut down for timber, agriculture and development each year; 1.5 acres a second, according
to [this site](http://www.rain-tree.com/facts.htm); just shy of 50 million acres.

If you were thinking of buying me a present for my birthday (hint hint, it's the 24th of
April) then I suggest you [save an acre of
Rainforest](http://www.worldlandtrust.org/supporting/gift.htm). It's only £25, so buy
someone else one too. And maybe one for yourself.

Ok, rant over.

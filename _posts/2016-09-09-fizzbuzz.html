<p>
The FizzBuzz interview question has been going around a while. If for some
reason you're not familiar with it, here's one wording of it:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For numbers divisible
by three print "fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by five
print "buzz". For numbers which are divisible by both three and five print
"fizzbuzz".
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Solutions using loops, recursion, if and switch statements abound. But here's
my (hopefully) novel solution to this problem. It uses <code>sed</code> an <code>xargs</code> and
runs in a Unix shell. It is tweetable (i.e. less than 140 chars) and uses no
conditionals:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">seq 5 5 100 | xargs -IX echo <span style="color: #008000;">"Xs/[0-9]*/buzz/"</span> &gt; f
seq 3 3 100 | xargs -IX echo <span style="color: #008000;">"Xs/[0-9]*/fizz/"</span> &gt;&gt; f
seq 1 100 | sed -f f
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here's how it works:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The first line creates sed commands to replace zero or more digits on every
5th line with the word "buzz"</li>
<li>The second line creates sed commands to replace zero or more digits on
every 3rd line with the word "fizz"</li>
<li>The 3rd line creates a list of numbers from 1 to 100 (the <code>seq 1 100</code> part)
and runs all the sed commands over each that, in order.</li>
</ol>

<p>
How does 15 become "fizzbuzz" though? The trick is in the "<b>zero</b> or more
digits" part. First sed runs <code>15s/[0-9]*/buzz/</code> which replaces all the digits
with "buzz". Then sed runs <code>15s/[0-9]*/fizz/</code> which replaces the <b>zero-length
string of no digits</b> with "fizz" but without removing the word "buzz".
</p>

<p>
The resulting output looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">

<p>
Addendum: Is this really a valid fizzbuzz solution? You tell me! It conforms
to the spec, but the program doesn't really look at the values 1 to 100 on
each line. Instead of the <i>values</i> on each line, it works with the <i>positions</i>
of the lines.

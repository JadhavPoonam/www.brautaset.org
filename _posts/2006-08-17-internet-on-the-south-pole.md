I've occasionally wondered how they manage to get Internet to research bases at the North or South pole. You migth think they'd use satellites, but to communicate with a satellite you need direct line of sight; communications satellites in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary">geostationary orbits</a>, due to the curvaceous nature of our planet, are under the horizon and cannot be seen from the poles.

So how do they do it? Cable? Pretty unthinkable, I thought. However, according to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2207259.stm">this article</a> that's exactly what they're planning to do: lay a cable nearly 2000 km across the polar ice to the South Pole. It also, more interestingly, explained how they <em>currently</em> manage to get Internet access: by exploiting ageing communications satellites that have drifted out of their geostationary orbits and can therefore be just seen part of the day...

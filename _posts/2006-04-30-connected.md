We finally have a network connection at the new place. Though we don't have ADSL yet
(there's a problem transferring it here because [plus](http://plus.net)'s website thinks
my flat is a business address) [plus](http://plus.net) kindly gives us a backup phone
connection. We tried to get it working yesterday but got no dialtone and figured the phone
was not working yet (it was only connected on Thursday, and there was talks about a fault
on the line somewhere). It still didn't work today but after unpacking a phone and
successfully making a call to my mobile we smelled a rat, and, indeed, we had a dead
socket. Plugging the modem into the master socket we could call out *just fine*.

Only problem is the cable is very short and the master socket is in the hallway. Luckily
there's a small closet just across for it with room for a seat. It'll be great to have
ADSL again though. Here's [Nadia](http://www.flickr.com/photos/skugg/137138509/) enjoying
our current connection arrangement.

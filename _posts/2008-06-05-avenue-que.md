[Dean](http://blog.unixdaemon.net/) and I went to see Avenue Q last night, having heard
rave reviews about it. Plus, he found some cheap tickets, which turned out to be really
good. There was only one problem: we both hated the show. So much, in fact, that we left
at the intermission and didn't bother going back for the second part. It was just too dull
to waste another hour of our lives on.

It wasn't the fault of the actors. (Not all of them, at least.) In particular, [Mark
Goldthorp](http://www.avenueqthemusical.co.uk/the-show/cast/mark-goldthorp.php) animated
his characters with great skill. And [Rebecca
Lock](http://www.avenueqthemusical.co.uk/the-show/cast/rebecca-lock.php), the leading
monster, did a hell of a job on the singing front. But skilful actors is not enough; it
has to be entertaining too, and this one was not. It was just full of platitudes.

This came as a bit of a surprise. We seemed to be the only ones in the audience not
enjoying the show. And it came with recommendations from people that we thought of as
friends that have (allegedly) been to see it several times. Now we need to re-assess these
friendships: <em>real</em> friends wouldn't trick friends into viewing Avenue Q.

The pulled-pork sandwich I had afterwards lifted the evening somewhat.

#+title: Rice instruction craziness
#+date: <2007-01-02>

I'm visiting parents over Christmas. They've started working already so
I'm heating dinner and cooking rice. I'm used to having a rice cooker do
that last job for me, so I glanced at the instructions at the back.
Despite Norwegian, Danish and Swedish being mutually intelligible,
particularly so in the written form, there are instructions in all three
languages.

I do not mind that, particularly, except that /they are all different/.
The Swedish instructions lists a different amount of water than the
other two, and the Danish lists different cooking times. I'm confident
that all three recipes produce edible rice, but is a bit of consistency
too much to ask?

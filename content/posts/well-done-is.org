#+title: Well done is
#+date: <2007-03-22>

My boss is very good at taking meeting notes so that everybody knows
what's going on. These notes are highly distilled and this week's notes
contained the following rather cryptic bullet point: /Well done is./
After puzzling over what he could have meant for a little while I
realised that it actually makes sense as a statement in its own right,
akin to /Unix improvements aren't./

Walking home from work today I spent some time philosophising over this.
I had in my head a long rambling post about the importance of stopping
to acknowledge that /well done is/ and how it could fundamentally change
people's lives in weird and wonderful ways. Unfortunately I arrived home
and Nadia gave me a cookie and now it's all lost forever.

Meh. It was a good cookie. It was worth it.

#+title: Optimising HTTP Cache Hit Rate

I wrote a post over on our company blog titled [[http://techblog.net-a-porter.com/2014/08/maximising-cache-hit-rates-for-rest-apis/][Maximising Cache Hit
Rates For Rest APIs]]. My team is responsible for producing (and
supporting) the product API currently being adopted across the
organisation. In it I detail a few techniques we've used to maximise
our cache hit rate.

The TL;DR version:

-  Require query parameters to be sorted alphabetically
-  Require multi-value query parameters to be sorted
-  Reject unrecognised query parameters

These restrictions serve to guard against accidental or unnecessary
differences in the URLs for functionally identical queries. For the
full details, please read the [[http://techblog.net-a-porter.com/2014/08/maximising-cache-hit-rates-for-rest-apis/][original post]].

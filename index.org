I'm a software engineer, husband, dad, and guitarist. I read a lot of
sci-fi & fantasy books, hack my Emacs config, and occasionally update
this site.

The site is primarily a blog: three recent articles, and three of my
favourites, are below. I also maintain a [[file:articles.org][full list of articles]], and an
[[file:feed.xml][RSS]] feed.

* Recent articles
** [[file:articles/2020/musical-goals.org][Musical Goals]]                                                      :Music:

** [[file:articles/2020/dark-mode.org][Dark Mode]]                                                          :Hacks:

* Older articles I'm fond of

   My first to reach the HackerNews front page. In weeks it got orders
   of magnitude more hits than the rest of my site put together.

** [[file:articles/2017/potter-coding-dojo.org][Potter Coding Dojo in Clojure]]                                    :Clojure:

   I like it because of the amount of iterations we went though, and
   the discussions I had with coworkers about it at all-hands.

** [[file:articles/2006/rise-of-the-machine.org][Rise of the Machine]]                                                :Hacks:

   I like this one because it was such a great learning experience!

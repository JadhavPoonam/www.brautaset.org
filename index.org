#+title: Stig's Soapbox

I'm Stig Brautaset. I build infrastructure at [[https://www.laterpay.net][LaterPay]].  Outside work
I occasionally find time to maintain this blog[fn::Honestly I mainly
seem to be futzing around with the build system. I should write
more!]. Sometimes I blog because I have something to say, sometimes
it's just to practice writing. Here are all my articles, most recent
first:

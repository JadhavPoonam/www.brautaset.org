#+title: Contact

If you want to contact me about one of my many software projects I ask
that you do so via its [[https://github.com/stig][GitHub]] page.

Otherwise the best way of contacting me---unless you have my mobile
phone number---is via email: [[mailto:stig@brautaset.org][stig@brautaset.org]].

If you don't like email & don't mind waiting a while for a response
you can alternatively try [[http://twitter.com/stigbra][Twitter]]. (I check Twitter roughly once a
week.)

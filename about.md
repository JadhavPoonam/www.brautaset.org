About Stig Brautaset
--------------------

I grew up in Hovdebygda, a village in
[Ørsta Municipality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ørsta) on the west coast of
Norway. I studied Electronics in Ørsta, Ålesund & Oslo. After interrupting my
studies by compulsory military service I moved to London to study Artificial
Intelligence at Westminster University in 2000. I still live in England,
though in March 2015 I moved from London to
[Berwick-upon-Tweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berwick-upon-Tweed).

I have worked in software development since I graduated in 2003. Over the
years employers have paid me to write HTML, PHP, Perl, C, JavaScript, Java,
Objective-C, Scala, Python, Bash and English.

I have accounts on more sites than I can remember. Most are in varying states
of lacking attention. Here are some:

* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/stigbra)
* [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/stigbrautaset)
* [Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/stigbra)

I'm a polyglot software developer, making software for fun and profit. I've
released toys and free software projects in C, Prolog, Perl, Objective-C, Java
and Scala. Employers have paid me to write HTML, PHP, Perl, C, JavaScript, Java,
Objective-C, Scala and English.

I am Norwegian but also consider myself a Londoner. I have lived here since
September 2000, except for a gap-year in Hong Kong 2011--2012.

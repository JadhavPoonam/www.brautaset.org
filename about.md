title: About Stig Brautaset
layout: page
---

I'm a polyglot software developer, making software for fun and profit. I've
released toys and free software projects in C, Prolog, Perl, Objective-C, Java
and Scala. Employers have paid me to write HTML, PHP, Perl, C, JavaScript, Java,
Objective-C, Scala and English.

I am Norwegian but also consider myself a Londoner. I have lived here
since September 2000, except for March 2011 to February 2012 when I
lived in Hong Kong.

Code by me
----------

My [GitHub profile][github] lists many software projects, some of
which may be useful to you. (Though most probably are not.) You are
welcome to make use of these, for free, as long as you adhere to their
respective licenses. For the ones provided under a BSD, this means
that you have to attribute me in your application.

I understand that the attribution requirement can sometimes be a
problem. Send me a mail and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.
(There may be a charge, or mutually agreeable attribution.)

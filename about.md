I am a Brit*ish* Norwegian, currently living near
[Berwick-upon-Tweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berwick-upon-Tweed) in the
English countryside.

I have worked in software development since 2003. Over the years have toyed
with C, Prolog, Perl, Objective-C, Java, Scala & Clojure. Employers have paid
me to write HTML, PHP, Perl, C, JavaScript, Java, Objective-C, Scala and
English.

I have profiles on many places across the web, in various states of lacking
attention, including these:

* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/stigbra)
* [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/stigbrautaset)
* [Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/stigbra)

About SBJson
------------

I wrote [SBJson][], a popular JSON parser & generator for Objective-C. You are
welcome to use it---and any other project available from my
[Github profile][github]---for free, as long as you adhere to their
respective licenses.

In most cases the license requires that you have to attribute me in your
application. I understand that this attribution requirement can sometimes be a
problem. If you let me know about the problem, I may agree to grant you an
alternative license.

I'm a polyglot software developer, making software for fun and profit. I've
released toys and free software projects in C, Prolog, Perl, Objective-C, Java
and Scala. I've been *paid* to write HTML, PHP (never again), Perl, C,
JavaScript, Java, Objective-C and Scala. (Roughly in order of occurrence.)

I am Norwegian but also consider myself a Londoner; I have lived here since
September 2000. (Except for a year in Hong Kong ending on Valentine's Day
2012.)
